## Background Context

Demand letters are a critical component of the litigation process, serving as formal requests for action before proceeding to court. Currently, attorneys spend considerable time reviewing source documents (medical records, incident reports, correspondence, etc.) to manually draft these letters. This manual process is time-consuming, often taking several hours per letter, and can create bottlenecks in the litigation workflow.

Steno has identified an opportunity to leverage AI technology to transform this process. By automating the initial draft generation and providing intelligent refinement capabilities, the Demand Letter Generator will significantly reduce the time burden on legal professionals while maintaining the quality and customization required for effective legal communications. This solution will integrate seamlessly into existing law firm workflows, allowing for collaboration, customization through firm-specific templates, and final export to standard document formats.

The solution addresses both efficiency concerns (time savings, faster case progression) and quality concerns (consistency, completeness, adherence to firm standards) while positioning Steno as an innovative technology partner to law firms.
